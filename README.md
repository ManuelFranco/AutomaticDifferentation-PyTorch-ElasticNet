# AutomaticDifferentiation-ElasticNet

This project aims to be a reimplementation of the Elastic Net algorithm using the automatic differentiation engine provided by the PyTorch library. The code implements linear regression, binary regression, and multivariable regression with one binary output and the other continuous.


# Prerequisites
The following libraries are required to run the code:

+ torch: PyTorch library for tensor computations
+ numpy: Numerical computing library
+ scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model selection
+ matplotlib: Plotting library

# Usage
The code provides several functions for training and evaluating GLMNET models. Here's an overview of the available functions:
