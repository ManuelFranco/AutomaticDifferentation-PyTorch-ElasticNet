# Pytorch-ElasticNet


This project is a re-implementation of the GLMNET algorithm in PyTorch. GLMNET is a regularization algorithm that combines L1 and L2 regularization for linear models. It provides a way to select and shrink variables in a linear model while controlling the amount of regularization applied.

# Prerequisites
The following libraries are required to run the code:

torch: PyTorch library for tensor computations
numpy: Numerical computing library
scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model selection
matplotlib: Plotting library
Install the required libraries using the following command:
